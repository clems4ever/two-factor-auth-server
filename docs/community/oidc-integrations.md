**Note** This is community-based content for which the core-maintainers cannot guarantee correctness. The parameters may change over time. If a parameter does not work as documented, please submit a PR to update the list.

## Currently Tested Applications

- GitLab (>= 13.0.0)
- Grafana (>= 8.0.5)
- MinIO (missing JWT claims / policies, see [minio/minio#12722])

## Known Callback URLs

If you do not find the application in the list below, you will need to search for yourself - and maybe come back to open a PR to add your application to this list so others won't have to search for them.

`<DOMAIN>` needs to be substituted with the full URL on which the application runs on. If GitLab, as an example, was reachable under `https://gitlab.example.com`, `<DOMAIN>` would be exactly the same.

| Application | Version                        | Callback URL                                             |
| :---------: | :----------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------: |
| GitLab      | `14.0.1`                       | `<DOMAIN>/users/auth/openid_connect/callback`            |
| MinIO       | `RELEASE.2021-07-12T02-44-53Z` | `<DOMAIN>/oauth_callback`                                |
| MinIO       | `RELEASE.2021-06-17`           | `<DOMAIN>/minio/login/openid`                            |
